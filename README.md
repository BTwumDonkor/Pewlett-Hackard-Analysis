# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees for the various roles and also to identify the  employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program for the Pewlett-Hackard company. Postgress SQL was used for the analysis.  Six tables were used for the analysis and an Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) which maped out the various tables and their connections through primary and reference keys.


Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
1. The first analysis involved identifying  the retiring employees by their title.
